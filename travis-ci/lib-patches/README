TeXworks lib-patches directory
==============================

The Windows and Mac OS X builds of texworks are created using a slightly patched
version of some libraries, to fix some bugs or provide some additional features
(such as added support for platform fonts).



Poppler patches (poppler-*.patch)
---------------------------------
The Windows and Mac OS X builds of texworks are created using a slightly patched
version of poppler, to provide some added support for platform fonts (on OS X)
and to allow the use of a "local" poppler-data directory as we cannot expect a
system-wide poppler installation on these platforms.

This directory contains the relevant patches, as used with poppler-0.16.4 for
the TeXworks 0.4 release.
 * poppler-qt4-globalparams.patch
   Provides support for a "local" poppler-data.
 * poppler-*-font-handling.patch
   Adds/enhances font support for different platforms. (Only the patch relevant
   for your platform is needed)
 * poppler-bogus-memory-allocation-fix.patch
   Fixes warning messages generated by glyphs of height zero (e.g., for space
   glyphs in some Mac fonts)
