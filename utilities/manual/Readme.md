[Open manual](https://sunderme.github.io/getting_started.html)

The manual is written as myST markdown to be processed with sphinx-doc.
The markdown-dialect is decribed [here](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) and [here](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/reference/).

The translation is done by calling `make html`

The result is in `./build/html/` , `getiting_started.html` as entry point.
