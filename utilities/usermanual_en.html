<h1><a name="SECTIONNEW">0. What's new</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTIONNEW19">0.1 Version 1.8.1 -> Version 1.9</a></h2>

<P>TexMakerX has been diligently extended for the last months. The
subsequent list gives a probably incomplete overview of new and
changed functionality:</P>
<ul>
	<LI><P>First steps for dynamic syntax highlighting have been
	implemented. For example references in in commands like \label or
	\ref are checked and are marked especially if the reference does not
	exist (in case of referencing) or if it has been defined multiple
	times.</P>
	<LI><P>The word completion system has been extended. It now uses
	&ldquo;kile&rdquo;-word lists which extend the number of known
	commands considerably. The key Tab can be used to complete common word bases in the present suggestion list like it is done in bash shells.
	Furthermore it can also complete normal text
	by proposing earlier used text parts. The two modes are
	distinguished by a backslash as starting letter. And finally &ldquo;User
	Tags&rdquo; (user defined text blocks) can be inserted  by using
	user defined abbreviations which replaced in the completion process.
	The old behavior of using key sequences for inserting user tags
	certainly is still available. And lastly user defined latex commands
	are automatically scanned and can be used for command completion.</P>
	<LI><P>Apart from using wizards, new documents can be created by
	using templates. User can add own templates which can be edited or
	removed later on if necessary.</P>
	<LI><P>The symbol panel was extended. It was also extended by &ldquo;kile&rdquo;
	symbol list. It also can insert &ldquo;tags&rdquo; from textual
	lists. And finally the column count automatically adapts to the
	available horizontal space. Not to mention that unwanted symbol
	lists can be hidden.</P>
	<LI><P>The symbol list selector was moved to the left edge to give
	more room for the symbols, like it was done in texmaker.</P>
	<LI><P>Hover help was implemented. Hovering the cursor over standard
	latex commands will present tool tip help. If it is hovers over
	references, the corresponding text passage which contains the label
	is shown as tool tip.</P>
	<LI><P>A preview for selected text can be shown either in the status
	panel or as tool tip.</P>
	<LI><P>The status/log/error panel can also be used in a tabbed
	manner if desired.</P>
	<LI><P>The online spell checker handles escaped chars like &ldquo;a
	or \&rdquo;{a} now correctly. It also refrain from spell checking in
	(some) latex command options like \ref{label} and some more.</P>
	<LI><P>The context menu of the structure view gives some useful
	option like selecting a complete section or indenting a section
	which means changing \section to \subsection and accordingly all
	included headings as well.</P>
	<li><p>A thesaurus was added. It allows search for word parts as well.</p>
	<LI><P>For sure, lots of bugs have been squashed !</P>
</ul>
<h1><a name="SECTION0">1. Configuring TexMakerX</a></h1>
Before using TexMakerX, you should configure the editor and latex related commands via the "Configure TexMakerX" command in the "Options" menu ("Preferences" under macosx).
<h2><a name="SECTION01">1.1 Configuring the editor</a></h2>
<p>
You can should set the default encoding for new files ("Configure TexMakerX" -> "Editor" -> "Editor Font Encoding") if you don't want utf8 as encoding. Don't forget to set the same encoding in the preamble of your documents. (e.g. \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}, if you use utf-8).<br>
TexMakerX can auto detect utf-8 and latin1 encoded files, but if you use a different encoding in your existing documents you have to specify it in the configuration dialog before opening them. (and then you also have to disable the auto detection)
</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION02">1.2 Configuring the latex related commands</a></h2>
<p>TexMakerX can't compile yours documents if the paths to the LaTeX related commands are wrong.<br>
The default settings should work with the recent and standard LaTeX distributions, but you could have to modify them ("Configure TexMakerX" -> "Commands"). To change a command, just click on the button at the end of the corresponding line and select the command in the file browser : TexMakerX will adapt automatically the syntax of the command.<br>
The <strong>%</strong> character represents the name of the file without the extension and the <strong>@</strong> character will be replaced by the current line number. If you need more options (e.g. absolute paths) use ? and  look at the instruction on the bottom of the configuration dialog.<br>
</p>
<p><IMG src="doc14.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION03">1.3 Configuring the spell checker</a></h2>
<p>
The spell checker uses the OpenOffice.org dictionaries. Only GPL French and British dictionaries are distributed with TexMakerX.<br>
Users can download others dictionaries here : <A href="http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries" target="_blank">http://wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Dictionaries</A><br>
To configure the spell checker : "Configure TexMakerX" -> "Editor" -> "Spelling dictionary" -> click on the button at the end of the line to select the dictionary with the file browser. If you specify a non existing file the edit gets red.<br>
Warning : spell checking with Ctrl+Shift+F7 starts at the cursor position and not at the beginning of the document.<br><br>
If the interactive spell checker is enabled (default), any wrong spelled word is underlined with a red wave. Click on it with the right mouse to open an menu with a list of possible corrections. There you can also move it to the ignore list. If your dictionary is very large (> 5MB), opening the context menu and showing possible suggestions can take some seconds. If you don't need the suggestion, you can press shift while right clicking and don't have to wait.<br><br>
The ignore list is normally saved in the same directory as the dictionary with the extension .ign. If this isn't possible (e.g. missing access) the list is stored in the user configuration directory.
</p>
<h1><a name="SECTION1">2. Editing a TeX document</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTION11">2.1 Usual commands</a></h2>
<p>The standard commands (cut, copy, find...) can be launched via the "Edit" menu and the "Edit" tool bar.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc1.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION12">2.2.1 Setting the preamble of a TeX document</a></h2>
<p>To define the preamble of your document, you can use the "Quick start" wizard ("Wizard" menu).</p>
<p><IMG src="doc2.png" border="1"></p>
<p>This dialog allows you to set the main features of your document (class, paper size, encoding...).<br>Note : You can add other options by clicking the "+" buttons. All yours settings are recorded.</p>
<p>You can also type your own preamble model in the editor : with the "Copy/paste" or "Save As" commands, you can use it for a new document.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION12a">2.2.2 Using Templates to start a new document</a></h2>
For new documents, templates can be used by using the command "File/New from template".
A dialogue gives a selection of templates.
<p><IMG src="template.png" border="1"></p>
New templates can be added by using the command "File/Make Template" on a opened document which you like to have has a template.
User added templates can be edited or deleted by using the context menu in the template selection dialogue.
Built-in templates can not be changed.
<h2><a name="SECTION13">2.3 Structure of a document</a></h2>
<p>To define a new part (section,subsection...) in your document with TexMakerX, just use this combo box in the tool bar :</p>
<p><IMG src="doc3.png" border="1"></p>
<p>This will cause a dialog to pop up which allows you to define the style of the part (section,subsection...).<br>Note : the "Structure View" is automatically updated.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc4.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION14">2.4 Browsing your document</a></h2>
<p>The "Structure View" (left panel) lets you quickly reach any part of your document. All you need to do is to click on any item (label, section...) and you will be taken to the beginning of the corresponding area in the editor. The mechanism for jumping to a line does not anymore only consider line numbers but really remembers text lines. Thus adding and removing lines will not lead to jumps to wrong locations.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc5.png" border="1"></p>
<p>The "Structure View" is automatically updated when you save or compile your document. You can also use the "Refresh Structure" ("Edit" menu) command at any moment.</p>
<p>Apart from labels,sections and includes, comments starting with %TODO are also scanned for and presented as section of its owhn in the structure view.
This can be used to create a kind of permanent bookmark in the text or just to note where some changes are still necessary.
</p>
<p>
The structure view also offers a context menu which allows to copy/cut all text which belongs to a section (including subsection) and paste it before or after a section.
Section can be indented/unindented which means that the hiearachy level is changed by one, i.e. \section is changed to \subsection, and all subsections are treated accordingly

</p>
<p>For each file, three bookmarks can be used to speed up navigation : just click on a line number to add or remove a bookmark. When you have already defined three bookmarks, you must remove one of them to add a new bookmark. To jump to the line corresponding to a bookmark in the editor, just click on the buttons in the status bar.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc20.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION15">2.5 Formatting your text</a></h2>
<p>You can quickly set the format of a part of your text with this tool bar :</p>
<p><IMG src="doc6.png" border="1"></p>
<p><b>Additional option:</b> a selected text can be directly framed by certain environments. Example: while clicking on the button "Bold" after having selected the word "Hello" , you will obtain the code: \textbf{Hello}.<br>This option is available for all the environments indicated by "[selection]" in the "LaTeX" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION16">2.6 Spacings</a></h2>
<p>The usual "spacing" commands are available in the "LaTeX" and "Math" menus. To insert quickly the "new line" LaTeX command, you can use the corresponding command in the toolbar (shortcut : Ctrl+Alt+return) </p>
<h2><a name="SECTION17">2.7 Inserting a list</a></h2>
<p>The usual list environments code can be insert quickly via the "LaTeX-List" menu.<br>Note : the shortcut for the \item command is Ctrl+Alt+H.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION18">2.8 Inserting a table</a></h2>
<p>With the "Tabular" wizard ("Wizard" menu), the LaTeX code for a tabular environment can be quickly inserted :</p>
<p><IMG src="doc7.png" border="1"></p>
<p>You can set the main features of your table.<br>Note : this dialog allows you to type directly the code in the cells.<br>The corresponding LaTeX code is automatically inserted in the editor.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION19">2.9 Inserting a "tabbing" environment</a></h2>
<p>To help you to insert a "tabbing" code, you can use the "Tabbing" wizard ("Wizard" menu) :</p>
<p><IMG src="doc8.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION110">2.10 Inserting a picture</a></h2>
<p>To insert a picture in your document, just use the "\includegraphics" command in the "LaTeX" menu. Then, click on the "browser" button in the dialog to select the graphic file.<br>Note : you can insert a "figure" LaTeX environment ("LaTeX - Environments" menu) before inserting the picture.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc9.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION111">2.11 Cross References and notes</a></h2>
<p>This toolbox in the toolbar allows you to insert quickly the label, cite, ref, footnote... code.<br>Note : the labels used in your documents are displayed in the "Structure View".</p>
<p><IMG src="doc10.png" border="1"></p>
<p><b>Additional option:</b>for the \ref command, a dialog box allows you to select directly the label.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION112">2.12 Inserting math formulae</a></h2>
<p>You can toggle in the "in-line math" environment with the "f(x)" button in the toolbar (shortcut : Ctrl+Alt+M) or with the "Math" menu. The shortcut for the "display math" environment is : Alt+Shift+M.<br> The "Math" toolbar allows you to insert the most currents mathematical forms (frac, sqrt...) like the \left and \right tags.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc11.png" border="1"></p>
<p>With the "symbols panels" in the structure view, you can insert the code of 400 mathematical symbols.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc12.png" border="1"></p>
<p>You can also define the format of your mathematical text via the "Math" menu.<br>For the "array" environments, a wizard (like the "Tabular" wizard) is available in the "Wizard" menu. With this wizard, you can select the environment : array, matrix, pmatrix.... The cells can be directly completed.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc13.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION113">2.13 Auto Completion</a></h2>
<p>Whenever you press \  followed by a letter, a list of possible LaTex tags is shown where you select the right one. If you write additional letters the list is filtered, so that only the tags starting with the already written text are shown. 
If the list contains words which all start with the same letter combination, you can press Tab to complete all common letters. If only one element is present in the list, Tab selects this one to do the completion, like Enter. This behaviour is similar to tab completion in bash shells.
You can also press Ctrl+Space to open this list whenever you want.<br>
If a tag has different options, a short descriptive text is inserted into your text, telling you the meaning of each option. You can press Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Right to select all positions.<br>
Furthermore normal text can be completed by starting to type a word and pressing Ctrl+Space. All apropriate words in the current document are used as possible suggestions.<br>
If a enviroment is to be inserted, typing in the beginning of the environment name and pressing Ctrl+Alt+Space gives suggestions for adequate enviroments which are inserted completely with \begin{env}..\end{env}<br>
And finally user tags can be assigned a abbreviation which can also be used with completion. Just type in the start of the abbreviation and start the completion with Ctrl+Space. The abbreviation should show up in the completion list, especially marked with &ldquo;abbreviation (template)&rdquo;.
</p>

<h2><a name="SECTION114">2.14 Thesaurus</a></h2>
TexMakerX has integrated a simple thesaurus. OpenOffice 2.x databases are used for this.
By placing the cursor on a word and activating the thesaurus (Ctrl+Shift+F8 or Edit/Thesaurus), it tries to find synonyms for this word. Please be patient if you start the thesaurus at first time since loading the database just occurs then and can take a few moments.
<p><IMG src="thesaurus.png" border="1"></p>
The first line to the left contains the word, for which a synonym is searched for.
The list below gives a list of word classes. The can be chosen to reduce the number of suggestions.
The column to the right contains the list of suggested synonyms.
A selected word from this list apears in the first line to the right as proposition for replacement of the text.
This word can be changed manually. It is also used to do further investigations for words and their synonyms which "start with" or "contain" that word. With "lookup" it can be directly used to look for a synonym for that word.
<h1><a name="SECTION2">3. Compiling a document</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTION22">3.1 Compiling</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to compile a document is to use the "Quick Build" command ("Quick" button - shortcut : F1). You can define the sequence of commands used by the "Quick Build" command via the "Configure TexMakerX" dialog.<br>You can also launch each command one by one (shortcuts : F2...F12 - see the "Tools" menu).<br> Note : the "Clean" command in the "Tools menu" allows you to erase the files (dvi, toc, aux...) generated by a LaTeX compilation (except the ps and pdf files).<br>
<b>Warning : all yours files must have an extension and you can't compile an "untitled" file or a file with a space in his name</b>.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION23">3.2 The log files</a></h2>
<p>With the "Quick Build" command, the log file is automatically displayed in the "Messages / Log file" pannel. While clicking on a number in the "Line" column, the cursor is placed on the corresponding line in the editor and the error is displayed. <br>
Remark : a summary of the latex errors and warnings is displayed before the full log file.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc15.png" border="1"></p>
<p>The "Next Latex Error"and "Previous LaTeX Error" commands allow to get to the errors detected during compilation.</p>
<p>Lines with errors, warnings, bad boxes will be highlighted with red, yellow or blue background and you can jump between them using Ctrl+Up/Down. (Ctrl+Shift for errors only, Ctrl+Alt for warnings only, Alt+Shift for bad boxes only)<br>
A tool tip will show more details of the mistake if you jump to a line (it is also shown if you move the mouse over the mark left from the line numbers).</p>
<h1><a name="SECTION3">4. Other features</a></h1>
<h2><a name="SECTION31">4.1 About documents separated in several files</a></h2>
<p>TexMakerX allows you to work onto documents separated in several files.<br>
To include a TeX file into your document, just use the "\include{file}" command in the "LaTeX" menu. The file will appear in the "Structure View". With a click on his name, TexMakerX will open it.</p>
<p>Then, you can define your "master document" with the "Options" menu. All the commands of the "Tools" menu will apply only to this document even when working on the "children" documents (you can even close the "master" document).<br>Note : you can leave the "master" mode with the "Options" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION32">4.2 Bibliography</a></h2>
<p>For the "bib" files , the "Bibliography" menu enables you to directly insert the entries corresponding to the standard types of document.<br>Note: the optional fields can be automatically deleted with the "Clean" command of the "Bibliography" menu.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc16.png" border="1"></p>
<h2><a name="SECTION33">4.3 Personals tags ans tools</a></h2>
<p>TexMakerX allows you to insert your own tags (shortcuts : Shift+F1...Shift+F10). These tags are defined with the "User - User Tags" menu.<br>Note : if the code of the menu is "%environment", TexMakerX will directly insert:<br>
\begin{environment }<br>
<br>
\end{environment }<br>
<br>
If you write %| somewhere the cursor will be placed at that place in the inserted text. (A second %| will select everything between them).<br>
Write %&lt;something%&gt; to mark it as descriptive text which can be selected by Ctrl+Left/Right.
</p>
<p><IMG src="doc17.png" border="1"></p>
<p>You can also launch your own commands (shortcuts : Alt+Shift+F1...Alt+Shift+F5). These commands are defined with the "User - User Commands" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION34">4.4 Pstricks support</a></h2>
<p>The main pstricks commands can be inserted with the "Pstricks" panel in the "Structure View".</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION35">4.5 Metapost support</a></h2>
<p>The metapost keywords can be inserted with the "Metapost" panel in the "Structure View" and the "mpost" command can be launched via the "Tools" menu.</p>
<h2><a name="SECTION36">4.6 The "Convert to Html" command</a></h2>
<p>This command (from the "Tools" menu ) produces a set of html pages from a LaTeX source file with one image for each html page. Each page in the slide presentation corresponds to one of the postscript pages you would obtain running LaTeX.<br>
The command also produces an index page corresponding to the table of contents you would obtain with LaTeX. Each item of the index page includes a link to the corresponding html page.</p>
<p>You can create links in the html pages by using the \ttwplink{}{} command in the tex file.<br>
Synopsis :<br> 
\ttwplink{http://www.mylink.com}{my text} (external link)<br>
\ttwplink{page3.html}{my text} (internal link)<br>
\ttwplink{name_of_a_label}{my text} (internal link)<br>
<b>Warning : </b>You can't use this command with the hyperref package (and some others packages). This command can only be used with the "Convert to html" tool.</p>
<p><IMG src="doc18.png" border="1"></p>
<p><IMG src="doc19.png" border="1"></p>


<h2><a name="SECTION37">4.7 "Forward/Inverse search" with TexMakerX</a></h2>
<p>
Some dvi viewers can jump to (and visually highlight) a position in the DVI file that corresponds to a certain line number in the (La)TeX source file.<br>
To use this feature, you can use the <b>@</b> character in the syntax of the dvi viewer command ("Configure TexMakerX" -> "Commands").<br>
Examples ("Forward search"):
<ul>
<li>To launch yap from TexMakerX : "C:/Program Files/MiKTeX 2.7/miktex/bin/yap.exe" -1 -s @%.tex %.dvi</li>
