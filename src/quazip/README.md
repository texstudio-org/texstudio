QuaZip is the C++ wrapper for Gilles Vollant's ZIP/UNZIP package
(AKA Minizip) using Trolltech's Qt library.

If you need to write files to a ZIP archive or read files from one
using QIODevice API, QuaZip is exactly the kind of tool you need.

See [the documentation](https://stachenov.github.io/quazip/) for details.
