To compile and install TeXstudio, write:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install

On Unix and MacOSX you can also use:
sudo sh BUILD.sh

(you only need to use sudo if you want to install it system-wide)

Requirements : 
* Qt tool kit (qt.io) (6.2+ recommended)
* Poppler for the internal pdf preview 
  (is automatically disabled if poppler is not found)
