QCodeEdit is a project aiming at the creation of a flexible and powerful text
editing framework for Qt4. It has started as a sub-project of Edyuk, copyright (c)
Luc Bruant, a free and open source IDE. As it proved successful it is also
released as a standalone library to make it easy for everyone to use such
a framework within other apps without having to reinvent the wheel.

Writing closed source applications with QCodeEdit is possible after buying a
proper license. For more informations about pricing and licensing conditions
please contact the author directly <non.deterministic.finite.organism@gmail.com>
Note that you will still need a Qt commercial license for that.

QCodeEdit depends on Qt 4.3, copyright (c) Trolltech AS , which can be downloaded at :
ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/qt/sources
